      <div>
        My name is Darrin and I am a full stack developer from Boulder, CO. My
        experience in development comes from a combination of self teaching and
        completing a coding boot camp at University of Denver. I love to learn
        and am constantly trying to add to my skillset. When I'm not coding you
        will likely find me playing disc golf, camping, fishing, or cooking. If
        the weather isn't cooperating with outdoor activities, I love to watch
        movies and read science fiction.
